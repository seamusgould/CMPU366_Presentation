abstract = {A case of artificial paranoid has been synthesized in the form of a computer simulation model. The model and its embodied theory are briefly described. Several excerpts from interviews with the model are presented to illustrate its paranoid input-output behavior. Evaluation of the success of the simulation will depend upon indistinguishability tests.}

abstract = {There is a resurgent interest in developing intelligent open-domain dialog systems due to the availability of large amounts of conversational data and the recent progress on neural approaches to conversational AI [33]. Unlike traditional task-oriented bots, an open-domain dialog system aims to establish long-term connections with users by satisfying the human need for communication, affection, and social belonging. This article reviews the recent work on neural approaches that are devoted to addressing three challenges in developing such systems: semantics, consistency, and interactiveness. Semantics requires a dialog system to not only understand the content of the dialog but also identify users’ emotional and social needs during the conversation. Consistency requires the system to demonstrate a consistent personality to win users’ trust and gain their long-term confidence. Interactiveness refers to the system’s ability to generate interpersonal responses to achieve particular social goals such as entertainment and conforming. The studies we select to present in this survey are based on our unique views and are by no means complete. Nevertheless, we hope that the discussion will inspire new research in developing more intelligent open-domain dialog systems.},
